    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">Research Statement</h1>

    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research focuses on advanced infrastructure materials —
        specifically the design, testing, and optimization of
        high-performance cementitious composites for long service life.
        I study how mixture design, curing, and reinforcement strategies
        influence strength, crack resistance, dimensional stability, and
        durability in real-world exposure conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        I combine large-scale experimental testing with materials
        characterization to connect mechanisms to performance.
        My work is grounded in ASTM, ACI, and AASHTO procedures and
        includes mechanical testing (compressive/flexural strength,
        fracture behavior, energy absorption), transport and durability
        evaluation (permeability and related indicators), and fresh-state
        behavior (rheology, setting, thixotropy for SCC).
        Characterization tools used across projects include SEM/EDS,
        XRD, FTIR, TGA, and rheology/image-based analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-0">
        A core theme across my projects is practical translation:
        generating clear, implementable guidance for infrastructure
        stakeholders on mix design, curing, protection systems, and
        performance troubleshooting.

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The goal of my work is to improve the long-term performance and
      reliability of concrete infrastructure through test-driven mix
      design and practical engineering guidance. By linking composition,
      curing, and reinforcement strategies to measurable performance,
      my research supports durable, resilient cementitious systems for
      structural and transportation applications, and helps reduce
      risk from premature cracking, transport-driven deterioration, and
      serviceability issues.
